# Udemy Transcription Translator Chrome Extension

## Overview

This JavaScript project is a Chrome extension designed to seamlessly translate transcriptions from the Udemy website. It captures live transcriptions, sends them to a translation server, and injects the translated subtitles back into the video as captions, timed to match the spoken content.

## Features

- **Automated Transcription Capture:** The extension hooks into Udemy's transcription system, extracting all visible transcriptions.
- **Server-Based Translation:** Transcriptions are sent to an external server for translation, providing accurate subtitles in the desired language.
- **DOM Mutation Monitoring:** Listens for changes in the Udemy HTML to identify active transcriptions and injects the corresponding translated subtitles into the video player.
- **Smooth User Experience:** Automatically synchronizes translated subtitles with the video's timeline.
